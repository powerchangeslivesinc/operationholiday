          Vendors bring specialized goods, services, or skills to Santaâ€™s
          Village. Use this form to apply as a vendor and indicate which ticket
          categories you would like to support. Vendors may include health
          professionals, stylists, artisans, counselors, or other service
          providers. By registering, you pledge to provide those services
          on-site during Santaâ€™s Village. Our team will confirm your
          application, provide booth setup instructions, and coordinate your
          placement based on the tickets you selected. Vendor participation not
          only showcases your expertise but also directly supports families in
          need by offering real, tangible aid during the holidays.
